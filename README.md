# Janrex
**J**ust **AN**other **R**andom **EX**citing Client
 
# wait so how to download?
so unlike other clients, Janrex aims to use the actual source code as the intended method of modification, the default build comes with a sky color script, and modification is done with the actual source code, although there is a `config.js` file to be used appropriately

build tools:
```
git
nodejs
yarn
```
download/run instructions:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/giantninja908/JANREX.git
cd JANREX
yarn #install deps
yarn start #run client
```
if you want to compile it, just run `yarn package-<PLATFORM>` but with your platform, ex: `yarn package-linux`
all compiled builds end up in the release-builds folder

# this seems pretty limiting....
this client is more of a gateway for different patches to be applied, for example if you wish to add another chromium flag, add it to main.js

# planned features.....
currently planned:
- discord rpc
- ~~actual icon~~
- ~~F4 lobby switcher builtin~~
- ~~building scripts~~
- ~~release builds~~
- discord server
- patch list for people to add (simular to the suckless hacking guide)
- more! (dm me on discord Giant#7650 I'll try to add what I can :])
