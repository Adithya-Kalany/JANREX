#Janrex
**J**ust **AN**other **R**andom **EX**citing Client
 
#wait so how to download?
so unlike other clients, Janrex aims to use the actual source code as the intended method of modification, the default build comes with a sky color script, and modification is done with the actual source code, although there is a `config.js` file to be used appropriately

build tools:
```
git
nodejs
yarn
```
download/run instructions:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/giantninja908/JANREX/
cd JANREX
yarn #install deps
yarn start #run client
```
you can use electron-builder or electron-packager to make executables, although that's completely up to the user

#this seems pretty limiting....
this client is more of a gateway for different patches to be applied, for example if you wish to add another chromium flag, add it to main.js
